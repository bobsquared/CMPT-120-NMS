## Explosions for Final assignment

def mild_explosions(planet_lst,planet_rocks):
    global mild_count
    planet_position = 0
    random = (r.randint(1,len(planet_lst)*5))
    for i in range(len(planet_lst)):

    return planet_rocks
##Mild explosions inputs the planet number list and the planet rocks list. It returns a new list for the planet rocks after the mild explosion occurs.
##Input and output does not include planet 0 as the explosions don't affect it.
##Global variable for mild_count so that we can count how many times the mild_explosion occurs in the game.

##Amazing explosions inputs the planet number list and the planet rocks list. It returns a list of lists.
##A new list for the planet rocks after the explosion occurs, and a new list for the number of planets.
##Input and output does not include planet 0 as the explosions don't affect it.
##Global variable for amazing_count so that we can count how many times the amazing_explosion occurs in the game.
